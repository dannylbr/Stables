# Stables

Welcome!
Those are the compressed last stables of each one project I'm developing. I'll accept any issue about any application in this very repository.

## ErrSol
ErrSol means Errors and Solutions, it scans errors in your Windows and you can read causes and solutions on cloud easily. It requires registration in my website - currently down :(

## PPCLR
PPCLR is Police Pursuits Chat Log Reader, that I made to San Andreas Police Pursuits SA-MP Server

## SCHS
SCHS is SA-PP Cleo Hack Scanner, that I also made to San Andreas Police Pursuits SA-MP Server to deal with cheat files filtering.
### SCHS Privacy Policy
PDF with the literal policy this system follows. This was required because of many users running the scanner and fear about your privacy.
### SCHSUpdater
This will keep you updated, always aligned with the last version, without having to download and extract every new one.
